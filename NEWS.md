# CSCORE 1.0.2 (2025-09-13)

## Improvements
* Fixed BLAS/LAPACK linking on Windows by adding `src/Makevars.win`.
* Standardized dimension and loop variables to use `arma::uword`, removing signed/unsigned comparison warnings.
* Ensured compatibility with R 4.5.1 and RcppArmadillo 15.x (validated via win-builder and GitHub Actions CI).
* Improved consistency of header includes (`RcppArmadillo.h` first) for more robust builds.

## Infrastructure
* Added GitHub Actions workflow for Windows CI with latest R and RcppArmadillo.
* Added Windows build status badge to README.
